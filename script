    "When I was a young duck, I lived with many dear friends. One day, we received terrible news: Miss Augustine had passed."
    "She was a bird like no other, a pillar in our community. We all decided to come together to celebrate her life."
    nvl clear
    "We’d share memories, feast, and laugh with one another in her honor. Max the dog, Champagne the cat, Honey and Hermine the owl twins, and myself, would have a celebration to remember."

    "It had been an entire night, and then half a day after that. Max warmed the doormat in front of the birdhouse, staring out at the clearing with woeful eyes. I’d asked him if he needed anything when I checked on him in the morning, ‘No, thank you Quacks.’ He hadn’t moved as far as I had observed. It was about time to check in again."
    "“Max.” I watched his ear perk at my voice. “Maxregard.” I laid a wing across his back. “We’re swiftly approaching our start time. Are you going to join us?”"
    "He didn’t answer at first, so I waited. He pulled in a deep breath, “Is it set up?”"
    "“I think the twins are rehearsing and the cake is almost ready.”"
    "Max hummed out a mournful note. “If it’s all the same to you, I’ll stay. For now.”"
    "I furrowed my brows as I searched for what to say. “Maxy? What are you waiting for?” The air stilled around us, as if the clearing itself was holding its breath."
    "Max sighed. “I don’t want to celebrate without Augustine’s photo albums. But,” he sighed again, “I’m locked out.” He looked at me with those mournful eyes and I knew that I couldn’t move him for the world. He rested his head on his paws once more, staring up at the birdhouse."
    "“I’m going to check on Champagne and the twins. If they’re all ready, will you come, even without…” It felt bad to even say, so I did not."
    "“Hmmmm.”"
    "I frowned, worried."
    "“If they’re ready I’ll come.”"
    "Thank goodness."
    "“Okay. I’m going to make sure everyone is prepared. I’ll see you soon Max.” Max resettled on the doormat, and I waddled off to shepherd the rest of our friends towards the celebration."

    "Champagne was a delightfully talented chef, always experimenting with what ingredients they used. They had a particular talent for discovering tasty flavor combinations that her friends would adore."

    "“Champagne,” I tried, my voice a whisper. Not even a single whisker flicked. The wind whistled a jaunty tune between tree branches, leaving the cat on her perch upon the piano, undisturbed."
    "“Champagne.” The feline didn’t budge! Hmph! Well, if that was how it was going to be…"
    "“Champagne I am going to reintroduce you to my watering can should you pretend to slumber any longer.” With this, Champagne sat up with a sigh."
    "“Who says I was pretending?” Their voice lolled out of their mouth with a syrupy purr rumbling beneath it."
    "I was familiar enough with her to know that her ears flicked and whiskers twitched whenever she was actually sleeping, which was precisely why I knew to pester her plainly when she lay still. But of course, I couldn’t tell her that."
    "“Call it intuition,” I said, tipping my bill up. I could see it in her eyes; the cat thought me quite petulant."
    "Fortunately the feeling was mutual."
    "“Max said he will not budge from the doorstep unless the party is set up. Is the food ready?”"
    "Champagne yawned. “I suppose we’ll be waiting a season then,” they said, and promptly curled back up in a ball."
    "I let out a disgruntled honk of confusion before I could stop myself. “A season? Heavens why! How long does it take to bake a cake?”"

    "One eye lazily opened to judge me. “I need berries to finish the cake. They are up there.” She flicked an ear. I looked up."

    "“You have claws. Climb up and get them if you need them,” I said without thinking, because I am a fool."
    "Champagne’s irises narrowed to slits. “The last time I climbed anything taller than the gardening shed, it took you lot nine hours to even find me, not to mention the three it took you to get me down.”"
    "I stamped at the dirt. It would have been much easier if they hadn’t been hissing and clawing the entire way down… No need to rile them up now."
    "“Would you be able to complete the cake if I get you those berries?”"
    "“I’d like to see you even attempt to get that height.” She knew that I was a weak flier, but still, it was rude to say to my face."
    nvl clear
    "“I’m not– Hmph. Fine, we’ll wait for you to get the berries,” I said. She closed her judgemental eye again, ready to pretend to sleep. “Do you know where the Owl Twins are?” Champagne’s ears flattened immediately. So she did."
    "“They were here making a ruckus earlier, but I was occupied with more important activities.”"
    "This could have meant anything from cooking to bathing to solving elaborate puzzles. I opened my beak to ask where they’d gone, but was interrupted before I could begin."
    "“What I did hear is that they were planning to continue making a ruckus on the rocks.”"

    "“honey i can’t get the timing right without your part. it’s a duet,” they countered."

    "“HMPH!”"
    "“yes that’s right.”"
    "I turned to the cat, “Champagne, you need those berries up there for your recipe, correct?” She nodded, though she looked as perplexed as a cat possibly could while still loafing. “The solution is simple. Honey, would you please fly up and get a bunch of those berries?”"

    "“I’m sorry ducky,” Champagne said into my wing, and if I didn’t know her I would have missed when she started rumbling beside me, her volume almost imperceptible."

    "“oh no. max…”"
    "“Do you need any help?” Champagne asked."
    "I shook my head. “No, so long as you can finish your cake and they can finish their music.” Honey played a few notes. “I’ll be all right. I think Max needs someone now though, I’ve left him long enough.”"
